    "- The zip() function in Python is a built-in function that takes iterables (can be zero or more), aggregates them in a tuple, and returns an iterator of tuples. The zip() function is useful for parallel iteration over multiple sequences. details\n",

    "NOTE: If the passed iterables have different lengths, the iterable with the least items decides the length of the new iterator."
