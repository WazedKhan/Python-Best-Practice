# Key Concepts:

**Class and Object** :

* A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
* An object is an instance of a class.

 **Attributes and Methods** :

* Attributes are variables that belong to a class.
* Methods are functions that belong to a class.

**Inheritance** :

* is a mechanism to create new class with the details of the existing class without modifying it
* The new class is called the derived (or child) class, and the existing class is called the base (or parent) class.

**Encapsulation** :

* bundling data or method that operates on data into a single unit
* to apply restriction on direct access on some of the object's component directly to prevent accidental modification on data

 **Polymorphism** : [more](https://www.scaler.com/topics/polymorphism-in-oops/)

* The ability to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).

 **Abstraction** : A class containing one or more than one abstract method is called an abstract class, [more](https://www.scaler.com/topics/abstract-class-in-python/)

* Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
